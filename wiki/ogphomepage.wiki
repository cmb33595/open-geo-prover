== Introduction ==

!OpenGeoProver (abbreviated *OGP*) is *Open Source* project in *Java* programming language for implementation of various *Automated Geometry Theorem Provers*.

This is the geometry tool used to examine whether certain statement about constructed geometry objects (points, lines and circles) is true or false.

It accepts geometry theorem in constructive form and produces the output result - whether the theorem is proved or disproved or can't be proved.

It can be used as a standalone application as well as a geometry tool that can be integrated in existing geometry systems.
(See [development_plans Plans for Development] page for more details about plans for further development of this project.)
