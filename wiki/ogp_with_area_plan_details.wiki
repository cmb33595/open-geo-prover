=Implementation of Area Method in OGP=

The area method is another geometric theorem proving method, which will be
implemented in !OpenGeoProver this summer (2012) during the Google Summer of Code
program.

Compared to Wu's method or the Gröbner basis method, it is a little less
powerful : it can not deal with conics, for example. On the other hand, it has
one big advantage : being not an algebraic method, it produces human-readable
proofs. This proofs are generally not the easiest, and they contain sometimes
long lines of calculus, but they always remain close to the geometric
construction.

The method is based on several observations : 

1) All classical geometrical assertions (AB is parallel/perpendicular to CD, AB
has the same length as CD, angle ABC has the same mesure as DEF, etc.) can be
described as equalities between geometric quantities of two types :

- oriented ratios AB/CD, where AB and CD are parallel,
- S_ABC, the (oriented) area of the triangle ABC,
- and Pythagoras difference P_ABC, defined as AB²+CB²-AC².

For example, "A and B belong to the same circle arc CD" can be re-written "S_ACD
=/= 0, S_BCD =/= 0, and S_CAD.P_CBD = S_CBD.P_CAD".

2) A large subset of figures made by ruler and compass can also be made with a
few (5) construction rules, on a formal system which deals only with points. An
figure, to be used with the area method, has to be constructed using only this
primitives :

- Construction of an arbitrary free point,
- Intersection of two lines
- Foot from a given point to a line
- Point Y on the line passing through a given point W, parallel to a given line
  AB, and verifying WY = rUV, where r is a rational expression in geometric
  quantities, or a variable.
- Construction of a point Y on the line passing throug a point U and
  perpendicular to a line UV, such that 4S_UVY/P_UVY=r, where r is a rational
  expression in geometric quantities, or a variable.

When we say "a line", it is actually given in the form of two different points.
So, each one of the primitive constructions above constructs a new point from a
set of points.

The only "ruler and compass" construction which is impossible to describe with
this system is the intersection between a circle and a line, or the intersection
between two circles. To be more specific (and this last remark explains why this
limitation is not really problematic), the only thing which is actually
impossible to do is to distinguish the two points created this way. So, if one
is already known (if we want to have the intersection between the line UV and
the circle centered in O, passing through U, for example), it becomes possible.

3) This primitives can easily be translated into equalities between the
geometric quantities exposed above.


So, the principle is simple : the algorithms processes all the construction
steps in reverse order, and in the formula it tries to show, every occurence of
intermediate points is replaced with previous points, thanks to "elimination
lemmas" (allowing to do that for all types of quantities, and for all
primitives). Finally, all we have to prove is the equality between two
rational expressions, which can be made very easily.
