==Stages in development on the main development trunk==

 # Fist stage is *A-stage* or initial development, that started by reimplementation of simple Wu's method from GCLC geometry system in Java programming language
    * *A.1* Implementation of main algebraic primitives (variables, powers, terms, polynomials and polynomial systems) and main algorithms for manipulation with these primitives. <== *Finished*
    * *A.2* Implementation of simple Wu's method (algorithm for triangulation and calculation of final reminder). <== *Finished*

 # *B-stage*
    xxx
 # *C-stage*
 # *D-stage*
