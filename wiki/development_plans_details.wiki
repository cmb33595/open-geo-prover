==Stages in development on the main development trunk==

Following table outlines all stages of development work on main development trunk. Stages are not chronological but stage A must be the first stage and also some stages cannot be started until some other work has been previously completed.

|| *Stage or sub-stage of work* || *Work Description* || *State of work* || *Comment* ||
|| *A* || _Initial development work_ || Testing + Documenting || Must be the first ||
|| *A.1* || _Algebraic primitives_ || *Finished* || ||
|| *A.2* || _Simple Wu's method_ || *Finished* || ||
|| *A.3* || _Transformation of geometry theorem to algebraic form_ || *Finished* || ||
|| *A.4* || _NDG Conditions - initial processing_ || *Finished* || ||
|| *A.5* || _Preparing documentation and examples_ || Ongoing || ||

The details about stages are given bellow:

 # Fist stage is *A-stage* or initial development, that started by reimplementation of simple Wu's method from GCLC geometry system in Java programming language
    * *A.1* Implementation of main algebraic primitives (variables, powers, terms, polynomials and polynomial systems) and main algorithms for manipulation with these primitives. <== *Finished*
    * *A.2* Implementation of simple Wu's method (algorithm for triangulation and calculation of final reminder). <== *Finished*
    * *A.3* Transformation of geometry constructions and theorem statements in algebraic form. <== *Finished*
    * *A.4* Processing of NDG conditions. <== *Finished*
    * *A.5* Fixing bugs. <== *Ongoing*
