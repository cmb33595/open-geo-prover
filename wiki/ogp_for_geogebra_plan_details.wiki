The details about each specific stage of work:

 # *A-stage* is initial work which should provide basic OGP proving features available in !GeoGebra software.
  * *A.1* - Preparations for main work are discussions and work about: 
   * desired functionality, 
   * how arguments and results will be transferred between OGP and !GeoGebra, 
   * adjustments of OGP license to match !GeoGebra's, 
   * removing of 3rd party libraries that can't be used in !GeoGebra (in order to keep its {{{'.jar'}}} file as small as possible),
   * ...
  * *A.2* - XML parsing of geometry constructions:
   * agreed format of XML that will be sent from !GeoGebra to OGP
   * using QDParser for parsing XML for constructions
   * adding support for various geometry constructions from !GeoGebra even if they are currently not supported by OGP (which is currently oriented to algebraic provers), like rays, segments, polygons etc.
  * *A.3* - Parsing of theorem statements:
   * agreed about format of most important geometry theorem statements
  * *A.4* - Replacement of 3rd party [http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/ log4j] logger with new used in !GeoGebra.
 # *B-stage* - Further development work - To Be Decided
